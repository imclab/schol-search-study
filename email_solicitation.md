#Transforming scholarly search with Mendeley: participants needed

Can scholarly searching be improved by using information stored in your Mendeley library?

Help answer this question by participating in a research study conducted by the University of North Carolina in the US. We’re looking for participants who are willing to let us record their academic searches and share their Mendeley library with us.  You will help us see whether academic search results can be personalized to your interests based on your Mendeley library.  And you will be paid $50 USD for helping us advance science!

To learn more about the study and sign up as a participant, please visit the [study website](http://jasonpriem.github.com/schol-search-study/overview_and_signup.html).
