#Transforming scholarly search with Mendeley: participants needed for UNC study

We're researchers here at UNC, doing a study to learn if we can use scholars' Mendeley libraries to customize their searches on Google Scholar and elsewhere.

Weâ€™re looking for participants willing to let us record their academic searches and access their Mendeley libraries. You can help us collect data--and we'll pay you $50 for helping us advance science!

To learn more about the study and sign up as a participant, please visit the study website http://jasonpriem.github.com/schol-search-study/overview_and_signup.html. Thanks!
