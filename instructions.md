# Participant instructions


## step 1: consent form

Before you can participate in the study, we need you to read and agree to the [consent form](http://jasonpriem.github.com/schol-search-study/consent.html). There's a link on the form to email us with your consent.

## step 2: allow mendeley access

Click on this link to [allow access to your Mendeley account](http://152.2.81.210/test-app/register/register.jsp). Follow the instructions listed there. When you're done, [email us](mailto:mendeley-study@email.unc.edu) your Mendeley username.

## step 3: install toolbar

First, turn off Google Instant (the toolbar can't parse Instant results):

1. Go to <http://www.google.com>.
1. Search for something (doesn't matter what)
1. click the gear icon in at the top-right of the screen and select "Search settings."
1.  Under "Google Instant predictions," select "Never show Instant results."

Second, install the toolbar that will track your searches:

1. Click this link to (A) [download the toolbar](https://github.com/jasonpriem/schol-search-study/raw/auto-record/lemurlogtoolbar.xpi) OR (B) [download the toolbar](https://github.com/jasonpriem/schol-search-study/raw/master/lemurlogtoolbar.xpi). Save it somewhere handy on your machine.
1. Drag the lemurlogtoolbar.xpi file you just downloaded onto an active Firefox window, and click "install now" on the dialog that pops up.

## step 4: use the toolbar (A)


### what it does

While the toolbar is turned on, it records

*  a snapshot of results pages from select search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, and Microsoft Academic Search), 
* the urls of every link you click on, and
* system events like new tabs opening.

### what you need to do

You've got two jobs. First, We don't want to record all your search and browsing behavior. So your responsibility is to toggle on toolbar recording (by clicking the "record" button) before you start a scholarly search, and then turn it back off when you're done with your search (by clicking the same button).

Second, after you run a search and click a result, you'll need to decide if the result is *relevant* to your search. If it is, click the checkmark icon on the right of the url bar.

### how to

**View the toolbar logs**: In Firefox, click Tools->QueryLog Toolbar.

**Delete items from the search logs**: This is handy if you recorded something that you think maybe you didn't want to. First, [locate your Firefox profile](http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles). Logs are in the lemurlogtoolbar_data directory, and can be edited with the text editor of your choice (Macs ship TextEdit, Windows has Notepad...but you can install your own, too).


## step 4: use the toolbar (B)

### what it does

While the toolbar is turned on, it records

*  a snapshot of results pages from select search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, and Microsoft Academic Search), 
* the urls of links you click on from results pages served by these search engines.

### what you need to do

This all happens automatically, but we do need you to do one thing manually. After you run a search and click a result, you'll need to decide if the result is *relevant* to your search. If it is, click the checkmark icon on the right of the url bar.

### how to

**View the toolbar logs**: In Firefox, click Tools->QueryLog Toolbar.

**Delete items from the search logs**: This is handy if you recorded something that you think maybe you didn't want to. First, [locate your Firefox profile](http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles). Logs are in the lemurlogtoolbar_data directory, and can be edited with the text editor of your choice (Macs ship TextEdit, Windows has Notepad...but you can install your own, too).

## step 5: submit toolbar data

Once your time in the study is up, we'll send you an email letting you know. You'll respond to the email with your data attached, uninstall the toolbar, and reactivate Google Instant.

1. Email us your data. Just attach your data files to the email like any other file. The files are in your [Firefox profile](http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Profiles) in the lemurlogtoolbar\_data directory, and are named lemurlogtoolbar\_log and lemurlogtoolbar\_pages.
1. To uninstall the toolbar, in Firefox select Tools->Add ons, then click "Remove" next to the toolbar and restart your browser.
1. To turn Google Instant back on, follow the same steps as you did to turn it off, but unselect "Never show instant results." 


## step 6: do survey

Follow the link to fill out the one-page [post-study survey](https://unc.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_86uB6V1UHZ8bFkM&Preview=Survey&BrandID=unc).

## step 7: do interview
