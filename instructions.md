## Step 1: Tell us your primary search tool

Email us a yes/no answer to this question: "is Google Scholar the primary tool you use for scholarly searches?" <a href="mailto:priem@email.unc.edu?subject=[schol-search q1]">Click here to send email.</a>

## Step 2: Complete consent form

Next, you'll read the [consent form](http://jasonpriem.github.com/schol-search-study/consent.html). There's a link on the form to email us with your consent. **After we receive your email consent we will follow-up with you.**

## Step 3: Allow mendeley access

We'll send you an email with instructions on how to grant us access to your mendeley library, and later how to install the Firefox search-tracking toolbar.
